In my video I tried to explain how python can be used to automate tasks in 
python. In this video I went through three examples:

1. Generating a random number of monkey heads (between 50 to 100) at random 
   locations in the 3D space.

2. Generating 225 Cubes on a virtual sphere in a symmetric fashion.

3. Creating a mesh in the shape of a sin wave.

All the code and scripts that I used are available under the scripts folder.
